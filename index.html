				Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat that may be simultaneously both alive and dead, a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement) in the course of developing the thought experiment.

				Schrödinger's Kitten is the culmination of our life-long dream to provide the very best in box-based feline companionship. From our beginnings as simple cat-herders, to the pinnacle of thought-experiment inspired pet supply; we are more than a business. We are more than a bunch of cat-filled box pushers. We are a family, and that is exactly what we want to provide to you. Come to Schrödinger's Kitten and learn to feel alive again, or don't.
